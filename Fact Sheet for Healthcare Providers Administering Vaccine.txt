DESCRIPTION OF COVID-19
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the
novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that appeared in late 2019. It is predominantly a
respiratory illness that can affect other organs. People with COVID-19 have
reported a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.
Symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Symptoms may
include: fever or chills; cough; shortness of breath; fatigue; muscle or body aches;
headache; new loss of taste or smell; sore throat; congestion or runny nose;
nausea or vomiting; diarrhea.
Revised: 12/2020                                                                       1

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Storage and Handling
During storage, minimize exposure to room light, and avoid exposure to direct
sunlight and ultraviolet light.
Do not refreeze thawed vials.
Frozen Vials Prior to Use
Cartons of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Multiple Dose Vials arrive in
thermal containers with dry ice. Once received, remove the vial cartons
immediately from the thermal container and store in an ultra-low temperature
freezer between -80ºC to -60ºC (-112ºF to -76ºF). Vials must be kept frozen
between -80ºC to -60ºC (-112ºF to -76ºF) and protected from light until ready to
use.
If an ultra-low temperature freezer is not available, the thermal container in which
the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine arrives may be used as temporary storage
when consistently re-filled to the top of the container with dry ice. Refer to the
re-icing guidelines packed in the original thermal container for instructions
regarding the use of the thermal container for temporary storage. The thermal
container maintains a temperature range of -90ºC to -60ºC (-130ºF to -76ºF).
Storage within this temperature range is not considered an excursion from the
recommended storage condition.
Thawed Vials Before Dilution
Thawed Under Refrigeration
Thaw and then store undiluted vials in the refrigerator [2ºC to 8ºC (35ºF to 46ºF)]
for up to 5 days (120 hours). A carton of 25 vials or 195 vials may take up to 2 or
3 hours, respectively, to thaw in the refrigerator, whereas a fewer number of vials
will thaw in less time.
Thawed at Room Temperature
For immediate use, thaw undiluted vials at room temperature [up to 25ºC (77ºF)] for
30 minutes. Thawed vials can be handled in room light conditions. Vials must reach
room temperature before dilution.
Undiluted vials may be stored at room temperature for no more than 2 hours.
Revised: 12/2020                                                                       2

Vials After Dilution
•   After dilution, store vials between 2°C to 25°C (35°F to 77°F) and use within
6 hours from the time of dilution.
•   During storage, minimize exposure to room light, and avoid exposure to
direct sunlight and ultraviolet light.
•   Any vaccine remaining in vials must be discarded after 6 hours.
•   Do not refreeze.
Dosing and Schedule
The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is administered intramuscularly as a
series of two doses (0.3 mL each) 3 weeks apart.
There are no data available on the interchangeability of the Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine with other COVID-19 vaccines to complete the vaccination
series. Individuals who have received one dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
Vaccine should receive a second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to
complete the vaccination series.
Dose Preparation
Prior to Dilution
•   The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Multiple Dose Vial contains a
volume of 0.45 mL, supplied as a frozen suspension that does not contain
preservative. Each vial must be thawed and diluted prior to administration.
•   Vials may be thawed in the refrigerator [2ºC to 8ºC (35ºF to 46ºF)] or at room
temperature [up to 25ºC (77ºF)] (see Storage and Handling).
•   Refer to thawing instructions in the panels below.
Dilution
Dilute the vial contents using 1.8 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (not
provided) to form the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. ONLY use 0.9% Sodium
Chloride Injection, USP as the diluent. This diluent is not packaged with the vaccine
and must be sourced separately. Do not use bacteriostatic 0.9% Sodium Chloride
Injection or any other diluent. Do not add more than 1.8 mL of diluent.
After dilution, one vial contains up to 6 doses of 0.3 mL. Vial labels and cartons
may state that after dilution, a vial contains 5 doses of 0.3 mL. The information in
this Fact Sheet regarding the number of doses per vial after dilution supersedes the
number of doses stated on vial labels and cartons.
•   Refer to dilution and dose preparation instructions in the panels below.
Revised: 12/2020                                                                        3

THAWING PRIOR TO DILUTION
•                                             Thaw vial(s) of Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine before use either
by:
o  Allowing vial(s) to thaw in the
refrigerator [2ºC to 8ºC (35ºF to
46ºF)]. A carton of vials may take up
to 3 hours to thaw, and thawed vials
can be stored in the refrigerator for
up to five days (120 hours).
o  Allowing vial(s) to sit at room
temperature [up to 25ºC (77ºF)] for
30 minutes.
•                                             Using either thawing method, vials
must reach room temperature before
dilution and must be diluted within 2
hours.
•                                             Before dilution invert vaccine vial
                                              gently 10 times.
•                                             Do not shake.
•                                             Inspect the liquid in the vial prior to
dilution. The liquid is a white to off-
white suspension and may contain
white to off-white opaque amorphous
particles.
•                                             Do not use if liquid is discolored or if
other particles are observed.
DILUTION
•   Obtain sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride
Injection, USP. Use only this as the
diluent.
•   Using aseptic technique, withdraw
1.8 mL of diluent into a transfer syringe
(21-gauge or narrower needle).
•   Cleanse the vaccine vial stopper with a
single-use antiseptic swab.
•   Add 1.8 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride
Injection, USP into the vaccine vial.
Revised: 12/2020                              4

•   Equalize vial pressure before removing
the needle from the vial by withdrawing
1.8 mL air into the empty diluent
syringe.
•   Gently invert the vial containing the
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine
10 times to mix.
•   Do not shake.
•   Inspect the vaccine in the vial.
•   The vaccine will be an off-white
suspension. Do not use if vaccine is
discolored or contains particulate
matter.
•   Record the date and time of dilution on
the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
Vaccine vial label.
•   Store between 2°C to 25°C (35°F to
77°F).
•   Discard any unused vaccine 6 hours
after dilution.
Revised: 12/2020                              5

PREPARATION OF INDIVIDUAL 0.3 mL DOSES OF PFIZER-BIONTECH
COVID-19 VACCINE
•   Using aseptic technique, cleanse the
vial stopper with a single-use antiseptic
swab, and withdraw 0.3 mL of the
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine
preferentially using a low dead-volume
syringe and/or needle.
•   Administer immediately.
Administration
Visually inspect each dose in the dosing syringe prior to administration. The
vaccine will be an off-white suspension. During the visual inspection,
•   verify the final dosing volume of 0.3 mL.
•   confirm there are no particulates and that no discoloration is observed.
•   do not administer if vaccine is discolored or contains particulate matter.
Administer the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine intramuscularly.
After dilution, vials of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine contain up to six doses
of 0.3mL. Low dead-volume syringes and/or needles can be used to extract up to
six doses from a single vial. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may
not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial. Irrespective of the
type of syringe and needle:
•   Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine.
•   If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of
0.3 mL, discard the vial and content.
•   Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials.
Contraindications
Do not administer Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to individuals with known
history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (see Full EUA Prescribing Information).
Warnings
Appropriate medical treatment used to manage immediate allergic reactions must
be immediately available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs
following administration of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.
Revised: 12/2020                                                                           6

Monitor Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients for the occurrence of
immediate adverse reactions according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention guidelines (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/).
Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant
therapy, may have a diminished immune response to the Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine.
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine may not protect all vaccine recipients.
Adverse Reactions
Adverse reactions following the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine that have
been reported in clinical trials include injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle
pain, chills, joint pain, fever, injection site swelling, injection site redness, nausea,
malaise, and lymphadenopathy (see Full EUA Prescribing Information).
Severe allergic reactions have been reported following the Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine during mass vaccination outside of clinical trials.
Additional adverse reactions, some of which may be serious, may become
apparent with more widespread use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.
Use with Other Vaccines

AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES
There is no approved alternative vaccine to prevent COVID-19. There may be
clinical trials or availability under EUA of other COVID-19 vaccines.
AUTHORITY FOR ISSUANCE OF THE EUA
The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) has declared a public health
emergency that justifies the emergency use of drugs and biological products during
the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, FDA has issued an EUA for the unapproved
product, Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, for active immunization against
COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age and older.
FDA issued this EUA, based on Pfizer-BioNTech’s request and submitted data.
Although limited scientific information is available, based on the totality of the
scientific evidence available to date, it is reasonable to believe that the
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine may be effective for the prevention of
COVID-19 in individuals as specified in the Full EUA Prescribing Information.
This EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine will end when the Secretary
of HHS determines that the circumstances justifying the EUA no longer exist or
when there is a change in the approval status of the product such that an EUA is
no longer needed.

2.1                                                                                                           Preparation for Administration
Prior to Dilution
•   The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Multiple Dose Vial contains a volume of 0.45 mL, supplied
as a frozen suspension that does not contain preservative. Each vial must be thawed and diluted prior to
administration.
•   Vials may be thawed in the refrigerator [2ºC to 8ºC (35ºF to 46ºF)] or at room temperature [up to 25ºC
(77ºF)] [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (19)].
•   Refer to thawing instructions in the panels below.
Dilution
•   Dilute the vial contents using 1.8 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (not provided) to form
the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Do not add more than 1.8 mL of diluent.
•   ONLY use 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP as the diluent. This diluent is not packaged with the
vaccine and must be sourced separately. Do not use bacteriostatic 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or
any other diluent.
•   After dilution, one vial contains up to 6 doses of 0.3 mL. Vial labels and cartons may state that after
dilution, a vial contains 5 doses of 0.3 mL. The information in this Fact Sheet regarding the number of
doses per vial after dilution supersedes the number of doses stated on vial labels and cartons.
•   Refer to dilution and dose preparation instructions in the panels below.
Revised: 12/2020                                                                                              13

THAWING PRIOR TO DILUTION
•   Thaw vial(s) of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
Vaccine before use either by:
o   Allowing vial(s) to thaw in the refrigerator [2ºC
to 8ºC (35ºF to 46ºF)]. A carton of vials may take
up to 3 hours to thaw, and thawed vials can be
stored in the refrigerator for up to five days
(120 hours).
o   Allowing vial(s) to sit at room temperature [up to
25ºC (77ºF)] for 30 minutes.
•   Using either thawing method, vials must reach room
temperature before dilution and must be diluted
within 2 hours.
•   Before dilution invert vaccine vial gently 10 times.
•   Do not shake.
•   Inspect the liquid in the vial prior to dilution. The
liquid is a white to off-white suspension and may
contain white to off-white opaque amorphous
particles.

PREPARATION OF INDIVIDUAL 0.3 mL DOSES OF PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19
VACCINE
•   Using aseptic technique, cleanse the vial stopper
with a single-use antiseptic swab, and withdraw
0.3 mL of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine
preferentially using low dead-volume syringes
and/or needles.
•   Administer immediately.
2.2                                                                                                             Administration Information
Visually inspect each dose in the dosing syringe prior to administration. The vaccine will be an off-white
suspension. During the visual inspection,
•   verify the final dosing volume of 0.3 mL.
•   confirm there are no particulates and that no discoloration is observed.
•   do not administer if vaccine is discolored or contains particulate matter.
Administer the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine intramuscularly.
After dilution, vials of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine contain up to six doses of 0.3 mL. Low
dead-volume syringes and/or needles can be used to extract up to six doses from a single vial. If standard
syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial.
Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle:
•   Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine.
•   If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the vial and
any excess volume.
•   Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials.
2.3                                                                                                             Vaccination Schedule for Individuals 16 Years of Age and Older
The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is administered intramuscularly as a series of two doses (0.3 mL
each) three weeks apart.
There are no data available on the interchangeability of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine with other
COVID-19 vaccines to complete the vaccination series. Individuals who have received one dose of
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine should receive a second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to
complete the vaccination series.

It is MANDATORY for vaccination providers to report to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System
(VAERS) all vaccine administration errors, all serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem
Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) in adults and children, and hospitalized or fatal cases of COVID-19
following vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. To the extent feasible, provide a
copy of the VAERS form to Pfizer Inc. Please see the REQUIREMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR
REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AND VACCINE ADMINISTRATION ERRORS section for details
on reporting to VAERS and Pfizer Inc.
In clinical studies, adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older included pain at the injection site
(84.1%), fatigue (62.9%), headache (55.1%), muscle pain (38.3%), chills (31.9%), joint pain (23.6%),
fever (14.2%), injection site swelling (10.5%), injection site redness (9.5%), nausea (1.1%), malaise (0.5%), and
lymphadenopathy (0.3%).
Severe allergic reactions have been reported following the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine during mass
vaccination outside of clinical trials.
6.1                                                                                                                    Clinical Trials Experience
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the
clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not
reflect the rates observed in practice.
Revised: 12/2020                                                                                                       17

The safety of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was evaluated in participants 16 years of age and older in
two clinical studies conducted in the United States, Europe, Turkey, South Africa, and South America.
Study BNT162-01 (Study 1) was a Phase 1/2, two-part, dose-escalation trial that enrolled 60 participants,
18 through 55 years of age. Study C4591001 (Study 2) is a Phase 1/2/3, multicenter, multinational, randomized,
saline placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-finding, vaccine candidate-selection (Phase 1) and efficacy
(Phase 2/3) study that has enrolled approximately 44,000 participants, 12 years of age or older. Of these,
approximately 43,448 participants (21,720 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine; 21,728 placebo) in Phase 2/3
are 16 years of age or older (including                                                                           138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and
placebo groups, respectively).
At the time of the analysis of Study 2 for the EUA, 37,586 (18,801 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and
18,785 placebo) participants 16 years of age or older have been followed for a median of 2 months after the
second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.
The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. The safety population includes participants enrolled by
October 9, 2020, and includes safety data accrued through November 14, 2020. Participants 18 years and older
in the reactogenicity subset are monitored for solicited local and systemic reactions and use of antipyretic
medication after each vaccination in an electronic diary. Participants are being monitored for unsolicited
adverse events, including serious adverse events, throughout the study [from Dose 1 through 1 month (all
unsolicited adverse events) or 6 months (serious adverse events) after the last vaccination].
Demographic characteristics in Study 2 were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race, and ethnicity
among participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and those who received placebo.
Overall, among the total participants who received either the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or placebo,
50.6% were male and 49.4% were female, 83.1% were White, 9.1% were Black or African American, 28.0%
were Hispanic/Latino,                                                                                             4.3% were Asian, and 0.5% were American Indian/Alaska Native.
Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions Solicited in the Study 2
Table 1 and Table 2 present the frequency and severity of solicited local and systemic reactions, respectively,
within 7 days following each dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and placebo in the subset of
participants 18 to 55 years of age included in the EUA safety population who were monitored for reactogenicity
with an electronic diary.
Table 3 and Table 4 present the frequency and severity of reported solicited local and systemic reactions,
respectively, within 7 days of each dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and placebo for participants
56 years of age and older.
Across both age groups, the mean duration of pain at the injection site after Dose 2 was 2.5 days (range 1 to
36 days), for redness 2.6 days (range 1 to 34 days), and for swelling 2.3 days (range 1 to 34 days) for
participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group.
Solicited reactogenicity data in 16 and 17 year-old participants are limited.

Unsolicited Adverse Events
Serious Adverse Events
In Study 2, among participants 16 to 55 years of age who had received at least 1 dose of vaccine or placebo
(Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine = 10,841; placebo = 10,851), serious adverse events from Dose 1
through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported by 0.4% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
Vaccine recipients and by 0.3% of placebo recipients. In a similar analysis, in participants 56 years of age and
older (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine = 7960, placebo = 7934), serious adverse events were reported by
0.8% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 0.6% of placebo recipients who received at
least 1 dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or placebo, respectively. In these analyses, 91.6% of study
participants had at least 30 days of follow-up after Dose 2. Appendicitis was reported as a serious adverse event
for 12 participants, and numerically higher in the vaccine group, 8 vaccine participants and 4 placebo
participants. Currently available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine.
There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories
of serious adverse events (including neurologic, neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest
a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.
Non-Serious Adverse Events
Overall in Study 2 in which 10,841 participants 16 to 55 years of age received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
Vaccine and 10,851 participants received placebo, non-serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to
30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported in 29.3% of participants who received
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 13.2% of participants in the placebo group, for participants who
received at least 1 dose. Overall in a similar analysis in which 7960 participants 56 years of age and older
received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, non-serious adverse events within 30 days were reported in
23.8% of participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 11.7% of participants in the
placebo group, for participants who received at least 1 dose. In these analyses, 91.6% of study participants had
at least 30 days of follow-up after Dose 2. The higher frequency of reported unsolicited non-serious adverse
events among Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients compared to placebo recipients was primarily
attributed to local and systemic adverse events reported during the first 7 days following vaccination that are
consistent with adverse reactions solicited among participants in the reactogenicity subset and presented in
Tables 3 and 4. From Dose 1 through 30 days after Dose 2, reports of lymphadenopathy were imbalanced with
notably more cases in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group (64) vs. the placebo group (6), which is
plausibly related to vaccination. Throughout the safety follow-up period to date, Bell’s palsy (facial paralysis)
was reported by four participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group. Onset of facial paralysis
was Day 37 after Dose 1 (participant did not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of
Bell’s palsy were reported in the placebo group. Currently available information is insufficient to determine a
causal relationship with the vaccine. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between
treatment groups for specific categories of non-serious adverse events (including other neurologic or neuro-
inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
Vaccine.

11.1   Pregnancy
Risk Summary
All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the
estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to
4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Available data on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine administered to
pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy.
11.2   Lactation
Risk Summary
Data are not available to assess the effects of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on the breastfed infant or on
milk production/excretion.
11.3   Pediatric Use
Emergency Use Authorization of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in adolescents 16 and 17 years of age is
based on extrapolation of safety and effectiveness from adults 18 years of age and older. Emergency Use
Authorization of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine does not include use in individuals younger than
16 years of age.

The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is supplied as a frozen suspension in multiple dose vials; each vial
must be diluted with 1.8 mL of sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP prior to use to form the vaccine.
Each dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine contains 30 mcg of a nucleoside-modified messenger
RNA (modRNA) encoding the viral spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2.
Each dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine also includes the following ingredients: lipids (0.43 mg
(4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate),                                               0.05 mg 2[(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-
N,N-ditetradecylacetamide, 0.09 mg 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and 0.2 mg cholesterol),
0.01 mg potassium chloride, 0.01 mg monobasic potassium phosphate, 0.36 mg sodium chloride, 0.07 mg
dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate, and 6 mg sucrose. The diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP)
contributes an additional                                                                                          2.16 mg sodium chloride per dose.

14.1   Mechanism of Action
The modRNA in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is formulated in lipid particles, which enable
delivery of the RNA into host cells to allow expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The vaccine elicits an
immune response to the S antigen, which protects against COVID-19.

18.1   Efficacy in Participants 16 Years of Age and Older
Study 2 is a multicenter, multinational, Phase 1/2/3, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind,
dose-finding, vaccine candidate-selection, and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older.
Randomization was stratified by age: 12 through 15 years of age, 16 through 55 years of age, or 56 years of age
and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who
were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19.
Participants with preexisting stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or
hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrollment, were included as were participants
with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or hepatitis B
virus (HBV).
In the Phase 2/3 portion approximately 44,000 participants 12 years of age and older were randomized equally
and received 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or placebo separated by 21 days. Participants are
planned to be followed for up to 24 months, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19.
Revised: 12/2020                                                                                                   26

The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included, 36,621 participants 12 years of age
and older (18,242 in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group and 18,379 in the placebo group) who did
not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. Table 5 presents

Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Suspension for Intramuscular Injection, Multiple Dose Vials are supplied
in a carton containing 25 multiple dose vials (NDC 59267-1000-3) or 195 multiple dose vials
(NDC 592671000-2). After dilution, one vial contains up to 6 doses of 0.3 mL. Vial labels and cartons may
state that after dilution, a vial contains 5 doses of 0.3 mL. The information in this Fact Sheet regarding the
number of doses per vial after dilution supersedes the number of doses stated on vial labels and cartons.
During storage, minimize exposure to room light, and avoid exposure to direct sunlight and ultraviolet light.
Do not refreeze thawed vials.
Frozen Vials Prior to Use
Cartons of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Multiple Dose Vials arrive in thermal containers with dry ice.
Once received, remove the vial cartons immediately from the thermal container and store in an ultra-low
temperature freezer between -80ºC to -60ºC (-112ºF to -76ºF). Vials must be kept frozen between -80ºC
to -60ºC (-112ºF to -76ºF) and protected from light, in the original cartons, until ready to use.
If an ultra-low temperature freezer is not available, the thermal container in which the Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine arrives may be used as temporary storage when consistently re-filled to the top of the
container with dry ice. Refer to the re-icing guidelines packed in the original thermal container for instructions
regarding the use of the thermal container for temporary storage. The thermal container maintains a temperature
range of -90ºC to -60ºC (-130ºF to -76ºF). Storage within this temperature range is not considered an excursion
from the recommended storage condition.
Thawed Vials Before Dilution
Thawed Under Refrigeration
Thaw and then store undiluted vials in the refrigerator [2ºC to 8ºC (35ºF to 46ºF)] for up to 5 days (120 hours).
A carton of 25 vials or 195 vials may take up to 2 or 3 hours, respectively, to thaw in the refrigerator, whereas a
fewer number of vials will thaw in less time.
Thawed at Room Temperature
For immediate use, thaw undiluted vials at room temperature [up to 25ºC (77ºF)] for 30 minutes. Thawed vials
can be handled in room light conditions.
Vials must reach room temperature before dilution.
Undiluted vials may be stored at room temperature for no more than 2 hours.
Revised: 12/2020                                                                                                                     29

Vials After Dilution
After dilution, store vials between 2°C to 25°C (35°F to 77°F) and use within 6 hours from the time of dilution.
During storage, minimize exposure to room light, and avoid exposure to direct sunlight and ultraviolet light.
Any vaccine remaining in vials must be discarded after 6 hours. Do not refreeze.
