Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the
novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that appeared in late 2019. It is predominantly a
respiratory illness that can affect other organs. People with COVID-19 have
reported a wide range of symptoms, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.
Symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Symptoms may
include: fever or chills; cough; shortness of breath; fatigue; muscle or body aches;
headache; new loss of taste or smell; sore throat; congestion or runny nose;
nausea or vomiting; diarrhea.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Storage and Handling
During storage, minimize exposure to room light, and avoid exposure to direct
sunlight and ultraviolet light.
Do not refreeze thawed vials.
Frozen Vials Prior to Use
Cartons of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Multiple Dose Vials arrive in
thermal containers with dry ice. Once received, remove the vial cartons
immediately from the thermal container and preferably store in an ultra-low
temperature freezer between -90ºC to -60ºC (-130ºF to -76ºF) until the expiry date
printed on the label. This information in the package insert supersedes the storage
conditions printed on the vial cartons.
Cartons and vials of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine with an expiry date of
May 2021 through February 2022 printed on the label may remain in use for
3 months beyond the printed date as long as approved storage conditions
between -90ºC to -60ºC (-130ºF to -76ºF) have been maintained. Updated expiry

If not stored between -90ºC to -60ºC (-130ºF to -76ºF), vials may be stored at -25°C
to -15°C (-13°F to 5°F) for up to 2 weeks. Vials must be kept frozen and protected
from light until ready to use. Vials stored at -25°C to -15°C (-13°F to 5°F) for up to
2 weeks may be returned one time to the recommended storage condition of -90ºC
to -60ºC (-130ºF to -76ºF). Total cumulative time the vials are stored at -25°C
to -15°C (-13°F to 5°F) should be tracked and should not exceed 2 weeks.
If an ultra-low temperature freezer is not available, the thermal container in which
the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine arrives may be used as temporary storage
when consistently re-filled to the top of the container with dry ice. Refer to the
re-icing guidelines packed in the original thermal container for instructions
regarding the use of the thermal container for temporary storage. The thermal
container maintains a temperature range of -90ºC to -60ºC (-130ºF to -76ºF).
Storage of the vials between -96°C to -60°C (-141°F to -76°F) is not considered an
excursion from the recommended storage condition.
Transportation of Frozen Vials
If local redistribution is needed and full cartons containing vials cannot be
transported at -90°C to -60°C (-130°F to -76°F), vials may be transported at -25°C
to -15°C (-13°F to 5°F). Any hours used for transport at -25°C to -15°C (-13°F to
5°F) count against the 2-week limit for storage at -25°C to -15°C (-13°F to 5°F).
Frozen vials transported at -25°C to -15°C (-13°F to 5°F) may be returned one time
to the recommended storage condition of -90ºC to -60ºC (-130ºF to -76ºF).
Thawed Vials Before Dilution
Thawed Under Refrigeration
Thaw and then store undiluted vials in the refrigerator [2ºC to 8ºC (35ºF to 46ºF)]
for up to 1 month. A carton of 25 vials or 195 vials may take up to 2 or 3 hours,
respectively, to thaw in the refrigerator, whereas a fewer number of vials will thaw
in less time.

Administration
Visually inspect each dose in the dosing syringe prior to administration. The
vaccine will be an off-white suspension. During the visual inspection,
•   verify the final dosing volume of 0.3 mL.
•   confirm there are no particulates and that no discoloration is observed.
•   do not administer if vaccine is discolored or contains particulate matter.
Administer the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine intramuscularly.
After dilution, vials of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine contain six doses of
0.3 mL of vaccine. Low dead-volume syringes and/or needles can be used to
extract six doses from a single vial. If standard syringes and needles are used,
there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial.
Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle:
•   Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine.
•   If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of
0.3 mL, discard the vial and content.
•   Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials.
Contraindications
Do not administer Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to individuals with known
history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (see Full EUA Prescribing Information).
Warnings
Management of Acute Allergic Reactions
Appropriate medical treatment used to manage immediate allergic reactions must
be immediately available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs
following administration of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.

immediate adverse reactions according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) guidelines (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-
considerations/managing-anaphylaxis.html).
Myocarditis and Pericarditis
Postmarketing data demonstrate increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis,
particularly within 7 days following the second dose. The observed risk is higher
among males under 40 years of age than among females and older males. The
observed risk is highest in males 12 through 17 years of age. Although some
cases required intensive care support, available data from short-term follow-up
suggest that most individuals have had resolution of symptoms with conservative

The CDC has published considerations related to myocarditis and pericarditis
after vaccination, including for vaccination of individuals with a history of
myocarditis or pericarditis (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-
considerations/myocarditis.html).
Syncope
Syncope (fainting) may occur in association with administration of injectable
vaccines, in particular in adolescents. Procedures should be in place to avoid injury
from fainting.
Altered Immunocompetence
Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant
therapy, may have a diminished immune response to the Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine.
Limitation of Effectiveness
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine may not protect all vaccine recipients.
Adverse Reactions
Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials
Adverse reactions following the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine that have
been reported in clinical trials include injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle
pain, chills, joint pain, fever, injection site swelling, injection site redness, nausea,
malaise, lymphadenopathy, and decreased appetite (see Full EUA Prescribing
Information).
Adverse Reactions in Post Authorization Experience
Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, and other hypersensitivity
reactions (e.g., rash, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema), diarrhea, vomiting, pain in
extremity (arm), and syncope have been reported following administration of the
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine outside of clinical trials.
Myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported following administration of the
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine outside of clinical trials.
Additional adverse reactions, some of which may be serious, may become
apparent with more widespread use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.
Use with Other Vaccines
There is no information on the co-administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
Vaccine with other vaccines.

INFORMATION TO PROVIDE TO VACCINE RECIPIENTS/CAREGIVERS
As the vaccination provider, you must communicate to the recipient or their
caregiver, information consistent with the “Vaccine Information Fact Sheet for
Recipients and Caregivers” (and provide a copy or direct the individual to the
website www.cvdvaccine.com to obtain the Vaccine Information Fact Sheet) prior to
the individual receiving each dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine,
including:
•   FDA has authorized the emergency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
Vaccine, which is not an FDA-approved vaccine.
•   The recipient or their caregiver has the option to accept or refuse
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.
•   The significant known and potential risks and benefits of Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine, and the extent to which such risks and benefits are
unknown.
•   Information about available alternative vaccines and the risks and benefits of
those alternatives.
For information on clinical trials that are testing the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine to prevent COVID-19, please see www.clinicaltrials.gov.
Provide a vaccination card to the recipient or their caregiver with the date when the
recipient needs to return for the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
Vaccine.
Provide the v-safe information sheet to vaccine recipients/caregivers and
encourage vaccine recipients to participate in v-safe. V-safe is a new voluntary
smartphone-based tool that uses text messaging and web surveys to check in with
people who have been vaccinated to identify potential side effects after COVID-19
vaccination. V-safe asks questions that help CDC monitor the safety of COVID-19
vaccines. V-safe also provides second-dose reminders if needed and live
telephone follow-up by CDC if participants report a significant health impact
following COVID-19 vaccination. For more information, visit: www.cdc.gov/vsafe.

AUTHORITY FOR ISSUANCE OF THE EUA
The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) has declared a public health
emergency that justifies the emergency use of drugs and biological products during
the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, FDA has issued an EUA for the unapproved
product, Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, and for certain uses of
FDA-approved COMIRNATY for active immunization against COVID-19.
FDA issued this EUA, based on Pfizer-BioNTech’s request and submitted data.
For the authorized uses, although limited scientific information is available, based
on the totality of the scientific evidence available to date, it is reasonable to believe
that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and COMIRNATY may be effective for
the prevention of COVID-19 in individuals as specified in the Full EUA Prescribing
Information.
This EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and COMIRNATY will end
when the Secretary of HHS determines that the circumstances justifying the EUA
no longer exist or when there is a change in the approval status of the product such
that an EUA is no longer needed.

and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization.
The Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program
The Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) is a federal program
that has been created to help pay for related costs of medical care and other
specific expenses to compensate people injured after use of certain medical
countermeasures. Medical countermeasures are specific vaccines, medications,
devices, or other items used to prevent, diagnose, or treat the public during a public
health emergency or a security threat. For more information about CICP regarding

PREPARATION OF INDIVIDUAL 0.3 mL DOSES OF PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19
VACCINE
•   Using aseptic technique, cleanse the vial stopper
with a single-use antiseptic swab, and withdraw
0.3 mL of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine
preferentially using low dead-volume syringes
and/or needles.
•   Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine.
•   If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial
cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the
vial and any excess volume.
•   Administer immediately.
2.2                                                                                                                 Administration Information
Visually inspect each dose in the dosing syringe prior to administration. The vaccine will be an off-white
suspension. During the visual inspection,
•   verify the final dosing volume of 0.3 mL.
•   confirm there are no particulates and that no discoloration is observed.
•   do not administer if vaccine is discolored or contains particulate matter.
Administer the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine intramuscularly.
After dilution, vials of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine contain six doses of 0.3 mL of vaccine. Low
dead-volume syringes and/or needles can be used to extract six doses from a single vial. If standard syringes
and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial. Irrespective
of the type of syringe and needle:
•   Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine.
•   If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the vial and
any excess volume.
•   Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials.

Booster Dose:
A single Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine booster dose (0.3 mL) may be administered intramuscularly at
least 6 months after completing the primary series to individuals:
•                                                                                                                                   65 years of age and older

•                                                                                                                                   18 through 64 years of age with frequent institutional or occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2
A single booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine may be administered as a heterologous
booster dose following completion of primary vaccination with another authorized COVID-19 vaccine. The
eligible population(s) and dosing interval for the heterologous booster dose are the same as those authorized for
a booster dose of the vaccine used for primary vaccination.
The FDA-approved COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) and the EUA-authorized Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine have the same formulation and can be used interchangeably to provide doses for COVID-
19 primary vaccination or a booster dose.4

Appropriate medical treatment used to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available in
the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
Vaccine.
Monitor Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients for the occurrence of immediate adverse reactions
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines
(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/managing-anaphylaxis.html).

Postmarketing data demonstrate increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly within 7 days
following the second dose. The observed risk is higher among males under 40 years of age than among
females and older males. The observed risk is highest in males 12 through 17 years of age. Although some
cases required intensive care support, available data from short-term follow-up suggest that most individuals
have had resolution of symptoms with conservative management. Information is not yet available about

It is MANDATORY for vaccination providers to report to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System
(VAERS) all vaccine administration errors, all serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem
Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) in adults and children, and hospitalized or fatal cases of COVID-19
following vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. 5 To the extent feasible, provide a
copy of the VAERS form to Pfizer Inc. Please see the REQUIREMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR
REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AND VACCINE ADMINISTRATION ERRORS section for details
on reporting to VAERS and Pfizer Inc.

primary series included pain at the injection site (90.5%), fatigue (77.5%), headache (75.5%), chills (49.2%),
muscle pain (42.2%), fever (24.3%), joint pain (20.2%), injection site swelling (9.2%), injection site redness
(8.6%), lymphadenopathy (0.8%), and nausea (0.4%).
In a clinical study of participants 18 through 55 years of age, the most commonly reported adverse reactions
(≥10%) following administration of a booster dose were pain at the injection site (83.0%), fatigue (63.7%),
headache (48.4%), muscle pain (39.1%), chills (29.1%), and joint pain (25.3%).
Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following administration of the
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine outside of clinical trials.
Myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported following administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
Vaccine outside of clinical trials.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the
clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not
reflect the rates observed in practice.
Primary Series
The safety of the primary series Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was evaluated in participants 12 years of
age and older in two clinical studies conducted in the United States, Europe, Turkey, South Africa, and South
America. Study BNT162-01 (Study 1) was a Phase 1/2, two-part, dose-escalation trial that enrolled 60
participants, 18 through 55 years of age. Study C4591001 (Study 2) is a Phase 1/2/3, multicenter, multinational,
randomized, saline placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-finding, vaccine candidate-selection (Phase 1) and
efficacy (Phase 2/3) study that has enrolled approximately 46,000 participants, 12 years of age or older. Of
these, approximately 43,448 participants (21,720 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine; 21,728 placebo) in
Phase 2/3 are 16 years of age or older (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine
and placebo groups, respectively) and 2,260 adolescents are 12 through 15 years of age (1,131 and 1,129 in the
vaccine and placebo groups, respectively).
In Study 2, all participants 12 to <16 years of age, and participants 16 years of age and older in the
reactogenicity subset, were monitored for solicited local and systemic reactions and use of antipyretic
medication after each vaccination in an electronic diary. Participants are being monitored for unsolicited
adverse events, including serious adverse events, throughout the study [from Dose 1 through 1 month (all
unsolicited adverse events) or 6 months (serious adverse events) after the last vaccination]. Tables 1 through 6
present the frequency and severity of solicited local and systemic reactions, respectively, within 7 days
following each dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID 19 Vaccine and placebo.
Participants 16 Years of Age and Older
At the time of the analysis of Study 2 for the EUA, 37,586 (18,801 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and
18,785 placebo) participants 16 years of age or older had been followed for a median of 2 months after the
second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.
The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. The safety population includes participants 16 years and older
enrolled by October 9, 2020, and includes safety data accrued through November 14, 2020.
Demographic characteristics in Study 2 were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race, and ethnicity
among participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and those who received placebo.
Overall, among the total participants who received either the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or placebo,
50.6% were male and 49.4% were female, 83.1% were White, 9.1% were Black or African American, 28.0%
were Hispanic/Latino, 4.3% were Asian, and 0.5% were American Indian/Alaska Native.
Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions
Across both age groups, 18 through 55 years of age and 56 years and older, the mean duration of pain at the
injection site after Dose 2 was 2.5 days (range 1 to 36 days), for redness 2.6 days (range 1 to 34 days), and for
swelling 2.3 days (range 1 to 34 days) for participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group.
Solicited reactogenicity data in 16 and 17 year-old participants are limited.

vaccine dose, the adverse event profile was similar to that after the second dose and no grade 3 or grade 4
events were reported in recipients who were followed for one month following post Dose 3.
Unsolicited Adverse Events
Serious Adverse Events
In Study 2, among participants 16 through 55 years of age who had received at least 1 dose of vaccine or
placebo (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine = 10,841; placebo = 10,851), serious adverse events from
Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported by 0.4% of Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 0.3% of placebo recipients. In a similar analysis, in participants 56 years
of age and older (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine = 7,960, placebo = 7,934), serious adverse events were
reported by 0.8% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 0.6% of placebo recipients who
received at least 1 dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or placebo, respectively. In these analyses,
91.6% of study participants had at least 30 days of follow-up after Dose 2.
Appendicitis was reported as a serious adverse event for 12 participants, and numerically higher in the vaccine
group, 8 vaccine participants and 4 placebo participants. Currently available information is insufficient to
determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances
between treatment groups for specific categories of serious adverse events (including neurologic,
neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine.
Non-Serious Adverse Events
In Study 2 in which 10,841 participants 16 through 55 years of age received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
Vaccine and 10,851 participants received placebo, non-serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to
30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported in 29.3% of participants who received
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 13.2% of participants in the placebo group, for participants who
received at least 1 dose. Overall in a similar analysis in which 7960 participants 56 years of age and older
received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, non-serious adverse events within 30 days were reported in
23.8% of participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 11.7% of participants in the
placebo group, for participants who received at least 1 dose. In these analyses, 91.6% of study participants had
at least 30 days of follow-up after Dose 2.
The higher frequency of reported unsolicited non-serious adverse events among Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
Vaccine recipients compared to placebo recipients was primarily attributed to local and systemic adverse events
reported during the first 7 days following vaccination that are consistent with adverse reactions solicited among
participants in the reactogenicity subset and presented in Tables 3 and 4. From Dose 1 through 30 days after
Dose 2, reports of lymphadenopathy were imbalanced with notably more cases in the Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine group (64) vs. the placebo group (6), which is plausibly related to vaccination. Throughout
the safety follow-up period to date, Bell’s palsy (facial paralysis) was reported by four participants in the
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group. Onset of facial paralysis was Day 37 after Dose 1 (participant did
not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of Bell’s palsy were reported in the placebo
group. Currently available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. There
were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of
non-serious adverse events (including other neurologic or neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that
would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.

Adolescents 12 Through 15 Years of Age
In an analysis of Study 2, based on data up to the cutoff date of March 13, 2021, 2,260 adolescents
(1,131 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine; 1,129 placebo) were 12 through 15 years of age. Of these,
1,308 (660 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 648 placebo) adolescents have been followed for at least
2 months after the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is
ongoing.
Demographic characteristics in Study 2 were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race, and ethnicity
among adolescents who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and those who received placebo.
Overall, among the adolescents who received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, 50.1% were male and
49.9% were female, 85.9% were White, 4.6% were Black or African American, 11.7% were Hispanic/Latino,
6.4% were Asian, and 0.4% were American Indian/Alaska Native.
Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions
The mean duration of pain at the injection site after Dose 1 was 2.4 days (range 1 to 10 days), for redness
2.4 days (range 1 to 16 days), and for swelling 1.9 days (range 1 to 5 days) for adolescents in the
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group.

Unsolicited Adverse Events
In the following analyses of Study 2 in adolescents 12 through 15 years of age (1,131 of whom received
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 1,129 of whom received placebo), 98.3% of study participants had at
least 30 days of follow-up after Dose 2.
Serious Adverse Events
Serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported by
0.4% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 0.1% of placebo recipients. There were no
notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of serious adverse
events that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.
Non-Serious Adverse Events
Non-serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported
by 5.8% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 5.8% of placebo recipients. From Dose 1
through 30 days after Dose 2, reports of lymphadenopathy plausibly related to the study intervention were
imbalanced, with notably more cases in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group (7) vs. the placebo
group (1). There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific
categories of non-serious adverse events that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine.
Booster Dose Following a Primary Series of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or COMIRNATY
A subset of Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 through 55 years of age received a booster dose of
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine approximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after completing the
primary series. Additionally, a total of 23 Study 2 Phase 1 participants (11 participants 18 through 55 years of
age and 12 participants 65 through 85 years of age) received a booster dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
Revised: 20 October 2021                                                                                                            31

Vaccine approximately 8 months (range 7.9 to 8.8 months) after completing the primary series. Safety
monitoring after the booster dose was the same as that in the reactogenicity subset who received the primary
series.
Among the 306 Phase 2/3 participants, the median age was 42 years (range 19 through 55 years of age), 45.8%
were male and 54.2% were female, 81.4% were White, 27.8% were Hispanic/Latino, 9.2% were Black or
African American, 5.2% were Asian, and 0.7% were American Indian/Alaska Native. Among the 12 Phase 1
participants 65 through 85 years of age, the median age was 69 years (range 65 through 75 years of age), 6 were
male and all were White and Not Hispanic/Latino. Following the booster dose, the median follow-up time was
2.6 months (range 2.1 to 2.9 months) for Phase 1 participants and 2.6 months (range 1.1 to 2.8 months) for
Phase 2/3 participants.
Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions
Table 7 and Table 8 present the frequency and severity of reported solicited local and systemic reactions,
respectively, within 7 days of a booster dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for Phase 2/3 participants
18 through 55 years of age.
In participants who received a booster dose, the mean duration of pain at the injection site after the booster dose
was 2.6 days (range 1 to 8 days), for redness 2.2 days (range 1 to 15 days), and for swelling 2.2 days (range 1 to
8 days).

In Phase 1 participants ≥65 years of age (n = 12), local reaction pain at the injection site (n = 8, 66.7%) and
systemic reactions fatigue (n = 5, 41.7%), headache (n = 5, 41.7%), chills (n = 2, 16.7%), muscle pain (n = 4,
33.3%), and joint pain (n = 2, 16.7%) were reported after the booster dose. No participant in this age group
reported a severe systemic event or fever after the booster dose.
Unsolicited Adverse Events
Overall, the 306 participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 2.6 months after the
booster dose to the cut-off date (June 17, 2021).
In an analysis of all unsolicited adverse events reported following the booster dose, through 1 month after the
booster dose, in participants 18 through 55 years of age (N = 306), those assessed as adverse reactions not
already captured by solicited local and systemic reactions were lymphadenopathy (n = 16, 5.2%), nausea (n = 2,
0.7%), decreased appetite (n = 1, 0.3%), rash (n = 1, 0.3%), and pain in extremity (n = 1, 0.3%).
Serious Adverse Events
Of the 306 participants who received a booster dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, there were no
serious adverse events reported from the booster dose through 30 days after the booster dose. One participant
reported a serious adverse event 61 days after the booster dose that was assessed as unrelated to vaccination.

Booster Dose Following Primary Vaccination with Another Authorized COVID-19 Vaccine
The safety of a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine booster dose in individuals who completed primary
vaccination with another authorized COVID-19 Vaccine (heterologous booster dose) is inferred from the safety
of a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine booster dose administered following completion of Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine primary series (homologous booster dose) and from data from an independent National
Institutes of Health (NIH) study Phase 1/2 open-label clinical trial (NCT04889209) conducted in the United
States that evaluated a heterologous booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. In this study,
adults who had completed primary vaccination with a Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine 2-dose series (N=151), a
Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine single dose (N=156), or a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine 2-dose series
(N=151) at least 12 weeks prior to enrollment and who reported no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were
randomized 1:1:1 to receive a booster dose of one of three vaccines: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Janssen
COVID-19 Vaccine, or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Adverse events were assessed through 28 days
after the booster dose. An overall review of adverse reactions reported in the study following the Pfizer-
BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine heterologous booster dose did not identify any new safety concerns, as
compared with adverse reactions reported following a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine primary series
doses or homologous booster dose.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post authorization use of Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily, it is not always possible to reliably
estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure.
Cardiac Disorders: myocarditis, pericarditis
Gastrointestinal Disorders: diarrhea, vomiting
Immune System Disorders: severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, and other hypersensitivity reactions
(e.g., rash, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema)
Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: pain in extremity (arm)
Nervous System Disorders: syncope

Risk Summary
All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the
estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to
4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Available data on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine administered to
pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy.
In a reproductive and developmental toxicity study, 0.06 mL of a vaccine formulation containing the same
quantity of nucleoside-modified messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) (30 mcg) and other ingredients included
in a single human dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was administered to female rats by the
intramuscular route on four occasions: 21 and 14 days prior to mating, and on gestation days 9 and 20. No
vaccine-related adverse effects on female fertility, fetal development, or postnatal development were reported in
the study.

Clinical studies of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine include participants 65 years of age and older who
received the primary series and their data contributes to the overall assessment of safety and efficacy [see
Overall Safety Summary (6.1) and Clinical Trial Results and Supporting Data for EUA (18.1)]. Of the total
number of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients in Study 2 (N=20,033), 21.4% (n=4,294) were
65 years of age and older and 4.3% (n=860) were 75 years of age and older.
The safety of a booster dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in individuals 65 years of age and older is
based on safety data in 12 booster dose recipients 65 through 85 years of age and 306 booster dose recipients 18
through 55 years of age in Study 2. The effectiveness of a booster dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine
in individuals 65 years of age and older is based on effectiveness data in 306 booster dose recipients 18 through
55 years of age in Study 2.

From an independent report (Kamar N, Abravanel F, Marion O, et al. Three doses of an mRNA Covid-19
vaccine in solid-organ transplant recipients. N Engl J Med), safety and effectiveness of a third dose of the
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine have been evaluated in persons that received solid organ transplants. The
administration of a third dose of vaccine appears to be only moderately effective in increasing potentially
protective antibody titers. Patients should still be counselled to maintain physical precautions to help prevent
COVID-19. In addition, close contacts of immunocompromised persons should be vaccinated as appropriate for
their health status.

Study 2 is a multicenter, multinational, Phase 1/2/3, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind,
dose-finding, vaccine candidate-selection, and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older.
Randomization was stratified by age: 12 through 15 years of age, 16 through 55 years of age, or 56 years of age
and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the ≥56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who
were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19.
Participants with preexisting stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or
hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrollment, were included as were participants
with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or hepatitis B
virus (HBV).
In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through November 14, 2020, approximately
44,000 participants 12 years of age and older were randomized equally and received 2 doses of
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or placebo separated by 21 days. Participants are planned to be followed
for up to 24 months, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19.
The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included, 36,621 participants 12 years of age
and older (18,242 in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group and 18,379 in the placebo group) who did
not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. Table 9 presents
the specific demographic characteristics in the studied population.

consistent with COVID-19 (symptoms included: fever; new or increased cough; new or increased shortness of breath; chills; new or
increased muscle pain; new loss of taste or smell; sore throat; diarrhea; vomiting).
*   Participants who had no evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e., N-binding antibody [serum] negative at Visit 1 and
SARS-CoV-2 not detected by NAAT [nasal swab] at Visits 1 and 2), and had negative NAAT (nasal swab) at any unscheduled
visit prior to 7 days after Dose 2 were included in the analysis.

c.   GMTs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean logarithm of the titers and the corresponding CIs
(based on the Student t distribution). Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ.
d.   GMRs and 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the mean difference of the logarithms of the titers (Group 1
[12 through 15 years of age] - Group 2 [16 through 25 years of age]) and the corresponding CI (based on the Student t
distribution).
e.   Noninferiority is declared if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67.

Microneutralization Assay. The assay uses a fluorescent reporter virus derived from the USA_WA1/2020 strain and virus
neutralization is read on Vero cell monolayers. The sample NT50 is defined as the reciprocal serum dilution at which 50% of
the virus is neutralized.

Series in Participants 18 Through 55 Years of Age
Effectiveness of a booster dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was based on an assessment of 50%
neutralizing antibody titers (NT50) against SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020). In Study 2, analyses of NT50
1 month after the booster dose compared to 1 month after the primary series in individuals 18 through 55 years
of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the
booster vaccination demonstrated noninferiority for both geometric mean ratio (GMR) and difference in

From an independent report (Kamar N, Abravanel F, Marion O, et al. Three doses of an mRNA Covid-19
vaccine in solid-organ transplant recipients. N Engl J Med), a single arm study has been conducted in
101 individuals who had undergone various solid organ transplant procedures (heart, kidney, liver, lung,
pancreas) 97±8 months previously. A third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was administered
to 99 of these individuals approximately 2 months after they had received a second dose. Among the 59 patients
who had been seronegative before the third dose, 26 (44%) were seropositive at 4 weeks after the third dose. All
40 patients who had been seropositive before the third dose were still seropositive 4 weeks later. The prevalence
of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 68% (67 of 99 patients) 4 weeks after the third dose.

COVID-19 Vaccine
Effectiveness of a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine booster dose in individuals who completed primary
vaccination with another authorized COVID-19 Vaccine (heterologous booster dose) is inferred from
immunogenicity data supporting effectiveness of a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine booster dose

administered following completion of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine primary series and from
immunogenicity data from an independent NIH study Phase 1/2 open-label clinical trial (NCT04889209)
conducted in the United States that evaluated a heterologous booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
Vaccine. In this study, adults who had completed primary vaccination with a Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine
2-dose series (N=151), a Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine single dose (N=156), or a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
Vaccine 2-dose series (N=151) at least 12 weeks prior to enrollment and who reported no history of
SARS-CoV-2 infection were randomized 1:1:1 to receive a booster dose of one of three vaccines: Moderna
COVID-19 Vaccine, Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Neutralizing
antibody titers, as measured by a pseudovirus neutralization assay using a lentivirus expressing the SARS-CoV-
2 Spike protein with D614G mutation, were assessed on Day 1 prior to administration of the booster dose and
on Day 15 after the booster dose. A booster response to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was
demonstrated regardless of primary vaccination.

Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Suspension for Intramuscular Injection, Multiple Dose Vials are supplied
in a carton containing 25 multiple dose vials (NDC 59267-1000-3) or 195 multiple dose vials
(NDC 59267-1000-2). After dilution, one vial contains 6 doses of 0.3 mL. Vial labels and cartons may state that
after dilution, a vial contains 5 doses of 0.3 mL. The information in this Full EUA Prescribing Information
regarding the number of doses per vial after dilution supersedes the number of doses stated on vial labels and
cartons.
During storage, minimize exposure to room light, and avoid exposure to direct sunlight and ultraviolet light.
Do not refreeze thawed vials.
Frozen Vials Prior to Use
Cartons of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Multiple Dose Vials arrive in thermal containers with dry ice.
Once received, remove the vial cartons immediately from the thermal container and preferably store in an
ultra-low temperature freezer between -90ºC to -60ºC (-130ºF to -76ºF) until the expiry date printed on the
label. This information in the package insert supersedes the storage conditions printed on the vial cartons.
Cartons and vials of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine with an expiry date of May 2021 through February
2022 printed on the label may remain in use for 3 months beyond the printed date as long as approved storage
conditions between -90ºC to -60ºC (-130ºF to -76ºF) have been maintained. Updated expiry dates are shown

If not stored between -90ºC to -60ºC (-130ºF to -76ºF), vials may be stored at -25°C to -15°C (-13°F to 5°F) for
up to 2 weeks. Vials must be kept frozen and protected from light, in the original cartons, until ready to use.
Vials stored at -25°C to -15°C (-13°F to 5°F) for up to 2 weeks may be returned one time to the recommended
storage condition of -90ºC to -60ºC (-130ºF to -76ºF). Total cumulative time the vials are stored at -25°C
to -15°C (-13°F to 5°F) should be tracked and should not exceed 2 weeks.
If an ultra-low temperature freezer is not available, the thermal container in which the Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine arrives may be used as temporary storage when consistently re-filled to the top of the
container with dry ice. Refer to the re-icing guidelines packed in the original thermal container for instructions
regarding the use of the thermal container for temporary storage. The thermal container maintains a temperature
range of -90ºC to -60ºC (-130ºF to -76ºF). Storage of the vials between -96°C to -60°C (-141°F to -76°F) is not
considered an excursion from the recommended storage condition.
Transportation of Frozen Vials
If local redistribution is needed and full cartons containing vials cannot be transported at -90°C to -60°C
(-130°F to -76°F), vials may be transported at -25°C to -15°C (-13°F to 5°F). Any hours used for transport
at -25°C to -15°C (-13°F to 5°F) count against the 2-week limit for storage at -25°C to -15°C (-13°F to 5°F).
Frozen vials transported at -25°C to -15°C (-13°F to 5°F) may be returned one time to the recommended storage
condition of -90ºC to -60ºC (-130ºF to -76ºF).
Thawed Vials Before Dilution
Thawed Under Refrigeration
Thaw and then store undiluted vials in the refrigerator [2ºC to 8ºC (35ºF to 46ºF)] for up to 1 month. A carton of
25 vials or 195 vials may take up to 2 or 3 hours, respectively, to thaw in the refrigerator, whereas a fewer
number of vials will thaw in less time.
Thawed at Room Temperature
For immediate use, thaw undiluted vials at room temperature [up to 25ºC (77ºF)] for 30 minutes. Thawed vials
can be handled in room light conditions.
Vials must reach room temperature before dilution.
Undiluted vials may be stored at room temperature for no more than 2 hours.
Transportation of Thawed Vials
Available data support transportation of one or more thawed vials at 2°C to 8°C (35°F to 46°F) for up to
12 hours.
Vials After Dilution
After dilution, store vials between 2°C to 25°C (35°F to 77°F) and use within 6 hours from the time of dilution.
During storage, minimize exposure to room light, and avoid exposure to direct sunlight and ultraviolet light.
Any vaccine remaining in vials must be discarded after 6 hours. Do not refreeze.
