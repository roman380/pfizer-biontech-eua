DESCRIPTION OF COVID-19
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus,
SARS-CoV-2, that appeared in late 2019. It is predominantly a respiratory illness that can affect
other organs. People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms, ranging from
mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus.
Symptoms may include: fever or chills; cough; shortness of breath; fatigue; muscle and body
aches; headache; new loss of taste or smell; sore throat; congestion or runny nose; nausea or
vomiting; diarrhea.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Storage and Handling
The information in this Fact Sheet supersedes the information on the vial and carton labels.
During storage, minimize exposure to room light.
Revised: Mar/31/2021                                                                                1

The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine multiple-dose vials are stored frozen between -50º to -15ºC
(-58º to 5ºF). Store in the original carton to protect from light.
Do not store on dry ice or below -50ºC (-58ºF). Use of dry ice may subject vials to temperatures
colder than -50°C (-58°F).
Vials may be stored refrigerated between 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) for up to 30 days prior to first
use.
Vials may be stored between 8° to 25°C (46° to 77°F) for a total of 24 hours.
After the first dose has been withdrawn, the vial should be held between 2° to 25°C (36° to
77°F). Vials should be discarded 12 hours after the first puncture.
Thawed vials can be handled in room light conditions.
Do not refreeze once thawed.
Transportation of Thawed Vials at 2° to 8°C (35° to 46°F)
If transport at -50° to -15°C (-58° to 5°F) is not feasible, available data support transportation of
one or more thawed vials for up to 12 hours at 2° to 8°C (35° to 46°F) when shipped using
shipping containers which have been qualified to maintain 2° to 8°C (35° to 46°F) and under
routine road and air transport conditions with shaking and vibration minimized. Once thawed and
transported at 2° to 8°C (35° to 46°F), vials should not be refrozen and should be stored at 2° to
8°C (35° to 46°F) until use.
Dosing and Schedule
The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is administered intramuscularly as a series of two doses (0.5
mL each) 1 month apart.
There are no data available on the interchangeability of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine with
other COVID-19 vaccines to complete the vaccination series. Individuals who have received one
dose of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine should receive a second dose of the Moderna COVID-
19 Vaccine to complete the vaccination series.
Dose Preparation

FEDERAL COVID-19 VACCINATION PROGRAM
This vaccine is being made available for emergency use exclusively through the CDC COVID-
19 Vaccination Program (the Vaccination Program). Healthcare providers must enroll as
providers in the Vaccination Program and comply with the provider requirements. Vaccination
providers may not charge any fee for the vaccine and may not charge the vaccine recipient any
out-of-pocket charge for administration. However, vaccination providers may seek appropriate
reimbursement from a program or plan that covers COVID-19 vaccine administration fees for
the vaccine recipient (private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, HRSA COVID-19 Uninsured
Program for non-insured recipients). For information regarding provider requirements and
enrollment in the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program, see
https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/provider-enrollment.html.

Program requirements are encouraged to report them to the Office of the Inspector General, U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, at 1-800-HHS-TIPS or TIPS.HHS.GOV.
AUTHORITY FOR ISSUANCE OF THE EUA
The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has declared a public
health emergency that justifies the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the
COVID-19 Pandemic. In response, the FDA has issued an EUA for the unapproved product,
Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 18
years of age and older.
FDA issued this EUA, based on ModernaTX, Inc.’s request and submitted data.
Although limited scientific information is available, based on the totality of the scientific
evidence available to date, it is reasonable to believe that the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine may
be effective for the prevention of COVID-19 in individuals as specified in the Full EUA
Prescribing Information.
This EUA for the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine will end when the Secretary of HHS determines
that the circumstances justifying the EUA no longer exist or when there is a change in the

Administer the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine intramuscularly.
2.3 Dosing and Schedule
The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is administered intramuscularly as a series of two doses (0.5
mL each) 1 month apart.
There are no data available on the interchangeability of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine with
other COVID-19 vaccines to complete the vaccination series. Individuals who have received one
dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine should receive a second dose of Moderna COVID-19
Vaccine to complete the vaccination series.
3  DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS
Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is a suspension for intramuscular injection. A single dose is 0.5
mL.
4  CONTRAINDICATIONS
Do not administer the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine to individuals with a known history of
severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the Moderna COVID-19
Vaccine [see Description (13)].
5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
5.1  Management of Acute Allergic Reactions
Appropriate medical treatment to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately
available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of the
Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.
Monitor Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine recipients for the occurrence of immediate adverse
reactions according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines
(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/managing-anaphylaxis.html).
5.2  Altered Immunocompetence
Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy, may
have a diminished response to the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.
5.3  Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness
The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine may not protect all vaccine recipients.
6  OVERALL SAFETY SUMMARY
It is MANDATORY for vaccination providers to report to the Vaccine Adverse Event
Reporting System (VAERS) all vaccine administration errors, all serious adverse events,
cases of Multi-inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) in adults, and hospitalized or fatal cases of
Revised: Mar/31/2021                                                                            11

COVID-19 following vaccination with the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. To the extent
feasible, provide a copy of the VAERS form to ModernaTX, Inc. Please see the
REQUIREMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AND
VACCINE ADMINISTRATION ERRORS section for details on reporting to VAERS and
ModernaTX, Inc.
In clinical studies, the adverse reactions in participants 18 years of age and older were pain at the
injection site (92.0%), fatigue (70.0%), headache (64.7%), myalgia (61.5%), arthralgia (46.4%),
chills (45.4%), nausea/vomiting (23.0%), axillary swelling/tenderness (19.8%), fever (15.5%),
swelling at the injection site (14.7%), and erythema at the injection site (10.0%).
Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following administration of
the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine during mass vaccination outside of clinical trials.
6.1  Clinical Trials Experience
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates
observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical
trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
Overall, 15,419 participants aged 18 years and older received at least one dose of Moderna
COVID-19 Vaccine in three clinical trials (NCT04283461, NCT04405076, and NCT04470427).
The safety of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine was evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3 randomized,
placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical trial conducted in the United States involving 30,351
participants 18 years of age and older who received at least one dose of Moderna COVID-19
Vaccine (n=15,185) or placebo (n=15,166) (NCT04470427). At the time of vaccination, the
mean age of the population was 52 years (range 18-95); 22,831 (75.2%) of participants were 18
to 64 years of age and 7,520 (24.8%) of participants were 65 years of age and older. Overall,
52.7% were male, 47.3% were female, 20.5% were Hispanic or Latino, 79.2% were White,
10.2% were African American, 4.6% were Asian, 0.8% were American Indian or Alaska Native,
0.2% were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 2.1% were other races, and 2.1% were
Multiracial. Demographic characteristics were similar among participants who received Moderna
COVID-19 Vaccine and those who received placebo.
Solicited Adverse Reactions
Data on solicited local and systemic adverse reactions and use of antipyretic medication were
collected in an electronic diary for 7 days following each injection (i.e., day of vaccination and
the next 6 days) among participants receiving Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (n=15,179) and
participants receiving placebo (n=15,163) with at least 1 documented dose. Solicited adverse
reactions were reported more frequently among vaccine participants than placebo participants.
The reported number and percentage of the solicited local and systemic adverse reactions by age
group and dose are presented in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.

Solicited local and systemic adverse reactions reported following administration of Moderna
COVID-19 Vaccine had a median duration of 1 to 3 days.
Grade 3 solicited local adverse reactions were more frequently reported after Dose 2 than after
Dose 1. Solicited systemic adverse reactions were more frequently reported by vaccine recipients
after Dose 2 than after Dose 1.
Unsolicited Adverse Events
Participants were monitored for unsolicited adverse events for up to 28 days following each dose
and follow-up is ongoing. Serious adverse events and medically attended adverse events will be
recorded for the entire study duration of 2 years. As of November 25, 2020, among participants
who had received at least 1 dose of vaccine or placebo (vaccine=15,185, placebo=15,166),
unsolicited adverse events that occurred within 28 days following each vaccination were reported
by 23.9% of participants (n=3,632) who received Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine and 21.6% of
participants (n=3,277) who received placebo. In these analyses, 87.9% of study participants had
at least 28 days of follow-up after Dose 2.
Lymphadenopathy-related events that were not necessarily captured in the 7-day e-diary were
reported by 1.1% of vaccine recipients and 0.6% of placebo recipients. These events included
lymphadenopathy, lymphadenitis, lymph node pain, vaccination-site lymphadenopathy,
injection-site lymphadenopathy, and axillary mass, which were plausibly related to vaccination.
This imbalance is consistent with the imbalance observed for solicited axillary
swelling/tenderness in the injected arm.
Hypersensitivity adverse events were reported in 1.5% of vaccine recipients and 1.1% of placebo
recipients. Hypersensitivity events in the vaccine group included injection site rash and injection
site urticaria, which are likely related to vaccination. Delayed injection site reactions that began
>7 days after vaccination were reported in 1.2% of vaccine recipients and 0.4% of placebo
recipients. Delayed injection site reactions included pain, erythema, and swelling and are likely
related to vaccination.
Throughout the same period, there were three reports of Bell’s palsy in the Moderna COVID-19
Vaccine group (one of which was a serious adverse event), which occurred 22, 28, and 32 days
after vaccination, and one in the placebo group which occurred 17 days after vaccination.
Currently available information on Bell’s palsy is insufficient to determine a causal relationship
with the vaccine.
Revised: Mar/31/2021                                                                                                16

There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for
specific categories of adverse events (including other neurologic, neuro-inflammatory, and
thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.
Serious Adverse Events
As of November 25, 2020, serious adverse events were reported by 1.0% (n=147) of participants
who received Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine and 1.0% (n=153) of participants who received
placebo, one of which was the case of Bell’s palsy which occurred 32 days following receipt of
vaccine.
In these analyses, 87.9% of study participants had at least 28 days of follow-up after Dose 2, and
the median follow-up time for all participants was 9 weeks after Dose 2.
There were two serious adverse events of facial swelling in vaccine recipients with a history of
injection of dermatological fillers. The onset of swelling was reported 1 and 2 days, respectively,
after vaccination and was likely related to vaccination.
There was one serious adverse event of intractable nausea and vomiting in a participant with
prior history of severe headache and nausea requiring hospitalization. This event occurred 1 day
after vaccination and was likely related to vaccination.
There were no other notable patterns or imbalances between treatment groups for specific
categories of serious adverse events (including neurologic, neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic
events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.

11  USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
11.1                                                                                                Pregnancy
Pregnancy Exposure Registry
There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to
Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine during pregnancy. Women who are vaccinated with Moderna
COVID-19 Vaccine during pregnancy are encouraged to enroll in the registry by calling 1-866-
MODERNA (1-866-663-3762).
Risk Summary
All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general
population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically
recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Available data on Moderna
COVID-19 Vaccine administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine-
associated risks in pregnancy.
In a developmental toxicity study, 0.2 mL of a vaccine formulation containing the same quantity
of nucleoside-modified messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) (100 mcg) and other ingredients
included in a single human dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine was administered to female rats
by the intramuscular route on four occasions: 28 and 14 days prior to mating, and on gestation
days 1 and 13. No vaccine-related adverse effects on female fertility, fetal development, or
postnatal development were reported in the study.

11.2   Lactation
Risk Summary
Data are not available to assess the effects of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine on the breastfed
infant or on milk production/excretion.
11.3   Pediatric Use
Safety and effectiveness have not been assessed in persons less than 18 years of age. Emergency
Use Authorization of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine does not include use in individuals younger
than 18 years of age.
11.4  Geriatric Use
Clinical studies of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine included participants 65 years of age and older
receiving vaccine or placebo, and their data contribute to the overall assessment of safety and
efficacy. In an ongoing Phase 3 clinical study, 24.8% (n=7,520) of participants were 65 years of
age and older and 4.6% (n=1,399) of participants were 75 years of age and older. Vaccine
efficacy in participants 65 years of age and older was 86.4% (95% CI 61.4, 95.2) compared to
95.6% (95% CI 90.6, 97.9) in participants 18 to <65 years of age [see Clinical Trial Results and
Supporting Data for EUA (18)]. Overall, there were no notable differences in the safety profiles
observed in participants 65 years of age and older and younger participants [see Overall Safety
Summary (6.1)].
13  DESCRIPTION

Revised: Mar/31/2021                                                                               20

14  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
14.1 Mechanism of Action
The nucleoside-modified mRNA in the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is formulated in lipid
particles, which enable delivery of the nucleoside-modified mRNA into host cells to allow
expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The vaccine elicits an immune response to the S
antigen, which protects against COVID-19.

safety, and immunogenicity of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine in participants 18 years of age
and older is ongoing in the United States (NCT04470427). Randomization was stratified by age
and health risk: 18 to <65 years of age without comorbidities (not at risk for progression to
severe COVID-19), 18 to <65 years of age with comorbidities (at risk for progression to severe
COVID-19), and 65 years of age and older with or without comorbidities. Participants who were
immunocompromised and those with a known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were excluded
from the study. Participants with no known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection but with positive
laboratory results indicative of infection at study entry were included. The study allowed for the
inclusion of participants with stable pre-existing medical conditions, defined as disease not
requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 3
months before enrollment, as well as participants with stable human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) infection. A total of 30,420 participants were randomized equally to receive 2 doses of the
Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine or saline placebo 1 month apart. Participants will be followed for
efficacy and safety until 24 months after the second dose.
The primary efficacy analysis population (referred to as the Per-Protocol Set) included 28,207
participants who received two doses (at 0 and 1 month) of either Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine
(n=14,134) or placebo (n=14,073), and had a negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. In the Per-
Protocol Set, 47.4% were female, 19.7% were Hispanic or Latino; 79.5% were White, 9.7% were
African American, 4.6% were Asian, and 2.1% other races. The median age of participants was
53 years (range 18-95) and 25.3% of participants were 65 years of age and older. Of the study
participants in the Per-Protocol Set, 18.5% were at increased risk of severe COVID-19 due to at
least one pre-existing medical condition (chronic lung disease, significant cardiac disease, severe
obesity, diabetes, liver disease, or HIV infection) regardless of age. Between participants who
received Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine and those who received placebo, there were no notable
differences in demographics or pre-existing medical conditions.
Efficacy Against COVID-19
COVID-19 was defined based on the following criteria: The participant must have experienced
at least two of the following systemic symptoms: fever (≥38ºC), chills, myalgia, headache, sore
throat, new olfactory and taste disorder(s); or the participant must have experienced at least one
of the following respiratory signs/symptoms: cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,
or clinical or radiographical evidence of pneumonia; and the participant must have at least one

NP swab, nasal swab, or saliva sample (or respiratory sample, if hospitalized) positive for SARS-
CoV-2 by RT-PCR. COVID-19 cases were adjudicated by a Clinical Adjudication Committee.
The median length of follow up for efficacy for participants in the study was 9 weeks post Dose
2. There were 11 COVID-19 cases in the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine group and 185 cases in
the placebo group, with a vaccine efficacy of 94.1% (95% confidence interval of 89.3% to
96.8%).

Among all participants in the Per-Protocol Set analysis, which included COVID-19 cases
confirmed by an adjudication committee, no cases of severe COVID-19 were reported in the
Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine group compared with 30 cases reported in the placebo group
(incidence rate 9.138 per 1,000 person-years). One PCR-positive case of severe COVID-19 in a
vaccine recipient was awaiting adjudication at the time of the analysis.
19  HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING
Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Suspension for Intramuscular Injection Multiple-Dose Vials are
supplied as follows:
NDC 80777-273-99   Carton of 10 multiple-dose vials, each vial containing a maximum of
11 doses: range 10-11 doses (0.5 mL)
NDC 80777-273-98   Carton of 10 multiple-dose vials, each vial containing a maximum of
15 doses: range 13-15 doses (0.5 mL)
During storage, minimize exposure to room light.
Store frozen between -50º to -15ºC (-58º to 5ºF). Store in the original carton to protect from light.
Do not store on dry ice or below -50ºC (-58ºF). Use of dry ice may subject vials to temperatures
colder than -50°C (-58°F).
Vials may be stored refrigerated between 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) for up to 30 days prior to first
use. Do not refreeze.
Vials may be stored between 8° to 25°C (46° to 77°F) for a total of 24 hours.
After the first dose has been withdrawn, the vial should be held between 2° to 25°C (36° to
77°F). Vials should be discarded 12 hours after the first puncture.
Thawed vials can be handled in room light conditions.
Do not refreeze once thawed.
Transportation of Thawed Vials at 2°C to 8°C (35°F to 46°F)
If transport at -50° to -15°C (-58° to 5°F) is not feasible, available data support transportation of
one or more thawed vials for up to 12 hours at 2° to 8°C (35° to 46°F) when shipped using
Revised: Mar/31/2021                                                                                    23

shipping containers which have been qualified to maintain 2° to 8°C (35° to 46°F) and under
routine road and air transport conditions with shaking and vibration minimized. Once thawed and
transported at 2° to 8°C (35° to 46°F), vials should not be refrozen and should be stored at 2° to
8°C (35° to 46°F) until use.
