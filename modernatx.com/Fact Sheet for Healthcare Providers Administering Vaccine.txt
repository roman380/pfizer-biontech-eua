DESCRIPTION OF COVID-19
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus,
SARS-CoV-2, that appeared in late 2019. It is predominantly a respiratory illness that can affect
other organs. People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms, ranging from
mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus.
Symptoms may include: fever or chills; cough; shortness of breath; fatigue; muscle and body
aches; headache; new loss of taste or smell; sore throat; congestion or runny nose; nausea or
vomiting; diarrhea.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Storage and Handling
The information in this Fact Sheet supersedes the information on the vial and carton labels.
During storage, minimize exposure to room light.
The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine multiple-dose vials are stored frozen between -50º to -15ºC
(-58º to 5ºF). Store in the original carton to protect from light.
Do not store on dry ice or below -50ºC (-58ºF). Use of dry ice may subject vials to temperatures
colder than -50°C (-58°F).
Vials may be stored refrigerated between 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) for up to 30 days prior to first
use.
Vials may be stored between 8° to 25°C (46° to 77°F) for a total of 24 hours.
After the first dose has been withdrawn, the vial should be held between 2° to 25°C (36° to
77°F). Vials should be discarded 12 hours after the first puncture.
Thawed vials can be handled in room light conditions.
Do not refreeze once thawed.
Revised: Oct/20/2021                                                                                2

Transportation of Thawed Vials at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F)
If transport at -50° to -15°C (-58° to 5°F) is not feasible, available data support transportation of
one or more thawed vials for up to 12 hours at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) when shipped using
shipping containers which have been qualified to maintain 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) and under
routine road and air transport conditions with shaking and vibration minimized. Once thawed and
transported at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F), vials should not be refrozen and should be stored at 2° to
8°C (36° to 46°F) until use.

Administration
Visually inspect each dose of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine in the dosing syringe prior to
administration. The white to off-white suspension may contain white or translucent product-
related particulates. During the visual inspection,
•   verify the final dosing volume of 0.5 mL for a primary series dose or 0.25 mL for a
booster dose.
•   confirm there are no other particulates and that no discoloration is observed.
•   do not administer if vaccine is discolored or contains other particulate matter.
Administer the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine intramuscularly.
CONTRAINDICATION
Do not administer the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine to individuals with a known history of a
severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the Moderna COVID-19
Vaccine (see Full EUA Prescribing Information).
WARNINGS
Management of Acute Allergic Reactions
Appropriate medical treatment to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately
available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of the
Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.
Monitor Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine recipients for the occurrence of immediate adverse
reactions according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines
(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/managing-anaphylaxis.html).
Myocarditis and Pericarditis
Postmarketing data demonstrate increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly
within 7 days following the second dose. The observed risk is higher among males under 40
years of age than among females and older males. The observed risk is highest in males 18
through 24 years of age. Although some cases required intensive care support, available data
from short-term follow-up suggest that most individuals have had resolution of symptoms with
conservative management. Information is not yet available about potential long-term sequelae.
The CDC has published considerations related to myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination,
including for vaccination of individuals with a history of myocarditis or pericarditis
(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/myocarditis.html).
Syncope
Syncope (fainting) may occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines.
Procedures should be in place to avoid injury from fainting.
Altered Immunocompetence
Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may
have a diminished immune response to the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.
Revised: Oct/20/2021                                                                              5

Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness
The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine may not protect all vaccine recipients.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials
Adverse reactions reported in clinical trials following administration of the Moderna COVID-19
Vaccine include pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, chills,
nausea/vomiting, axillary swelling/tenderness, fever, swelling at the injection site, erythema at
the injection site, and rash. (See Full EUA Prescribing Information)
Adverse Reactions in Post-Authorization Experience
Anaphylaxis and other severe allergic reactions, myocarditis, pericarditis, and syncope have been
reported following administration of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine during mass vaccination
outside of clinical trials.
Additional adverse reactions, some of which may be serious, may become apparent with more
widespread use of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.
USE WITH OTHER VACCINES
There is no information on the co-administration of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine with other
vaccines.
INFORMATION TO PROVIDE TO VACCINE RECIPIENTS/CAREGIVERS
As the vaccination provider, you must communicate to the recipient or their caregiver,
information consistent with the “Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers” (and provide a copy
or direct the individual to the website www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine-eua to obtain the
Fact Sheet) prior to the individual receiving each dose of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine,
including:
•   FDA has authorized the emergency use of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, which is not
an FDA-approved vaccine.
•   The recipient or their caregiver has the option to accept or refuse the Moderna COVID-19
Vaccine.
•   The significant known and potential risks and benefits of the Moderna COVID-19
Vaccine, and the extent to which such risks and benefits are unknown.

FEDERAL COVID-19 VACCINATION PROGRAM
This vaccine is being made available for emergency use exclusively through the CDC COVID-
19 Vaccination Program (the Vaccination Program). Healthcare providers must enroll as
providers in the Vaccination Program and comply with the provider requirements. Vaccination
providers may not charge any fee for the vaccine and may not charge the vaccine recipient any

out-of-pocket charge for administration. However, vaccination providers may seek appropriate
reimbursement from a program or plan that covers COVID-19 vaccine administration fees for
the vaccine recipient (private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, HRSA COVID-19 Uninsured
Program for non-insured recipients). For information regarding provider requirements and
enrollment in the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program, see
https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/provider-enrollment.html.
Individuals becoming aware of any potential violations of the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination
Program requirements are encouraged to report them to the Office of the Inspector General, U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, at 1-800-HHS-TIPS or TIPS.HHS.GOV.
AUTHORITY FOR ISSUANCE OF THE EUA
The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has declared a public
health emergency that justifies the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the
COVID-19 Pandemic. In response, the FDA has issued an EUA for the unapproved product,
Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 18
years of age and older.
FDA issued this EUA, based on ModernaTX, Inc.’s request and submitted data.
Although limited scientific information is available, based on the totality of the scientific
evidence available to date, it is reasonable to believe that the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine may
be effective for the prevention of COVID-19 in individuals as specified in the Full EUA
Prescribing Information.
This EUA for the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine will end when the Secretary of HHS determines
that the circumstances justifying the EUA no longer exist or when there is a change in the
approval status of the product such that an EUA is no longer needed.

framework/emergency-use-authorization.
COUNTERMEASURES INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM
The Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) is a federal program that has been
created to help pay for related costs of medical care and other specific expenses to compensate
people injured after use of certain medical countermeasures. Medical countermeasures are
specific vaccines, medications, devices, or other items used to prevent, diagnose, or treat the
public during a public health emergency or a security threat. For more information about CICP

following the second dose is authorized for administration to individuals at least 18 years of age
who have undergone solid organ transplantation, or who are diagnosed with conditions that are
considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise.
Booster Dose:
The booster dose of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is 0.25 mL.
A single Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine booster dose (0.25 mL) may be administered
intramuscularly at least 6 months after completing a primary series of the Moderna COVID-19
Vaccine to individuals:
•                                                                                                    65 years of age and older
•                                                                                                    18 through 64 years of age at high risk of severe COVID-19
•                                                                                                    18 through 64 years of age with frequent institutional or occupational exposure to SARS-
CoV-2
A single booster dose of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (0.25 mL) may be administered as a
heterologous booster dose following completion of primary vaccination with another authorized
or approved COVID-19 vaccine. The eligible population(s) and dosing interval for the
heterologous booster dose are the same as those authorized for a booster dose of the vaccine used
for primary vaccination.

3  DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS
Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is a suspension for intramuscular injection.
•   Each primary series dose is 0.5 mL.
•   The booster dose is 0.25 mL.
4  CONTRAINDICATIONS
Do not administer the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine to individuals with a known history of
severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the Moderna COVID-19
Vaccine [see Description (13)].
5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
5.1  Management of Acute Allergic Reactions
Appropriate medical treatment to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately
available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of the
Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.
Monitor Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine recipients for the occurrence of immediate adverse
reactions according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines
(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/managing-anaphylaxis.html).
5.2  Myocarditis and Pericarditis
Postmarketing data demonstrate increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly
within 7 days following the second dose. The observed risk is higher among males under 40
years of age than among females and older males. The observed risk is highest in males 18
through 24 years of age. Although some cases required intensive care support, available data
from short-term follow-up suggest that most individuals have had resolution of symptoms with
conservative management. Information is not yet available about potential long-term sequelae.
The CDC has published considerations related to myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination,
including for vaccination of individuals with a history of myocarditis or pericarditis
(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/myocarditis.html).
5.3   Syncope
Syncope (fainting) may occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines.
Procedures should be in place to avoid injury from fainting.
5.4  Altered Immunocompetence
Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy, may
have a diminished response to the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.
Revised: Oct/20/2021                                                                              14

5.5  Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness
The Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine may not protect all vaccine recipients.
6  OVERALL SAFETY SUMMARY
It is MANDATORY for vaccination providers to report to the Vaccine Adverse Event
Reporting System (VAERS) all vaccine administration errors, all serious adverse events,
cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) in adults, and hospitalized or fatal
cases of COVID-19 following vaccination with the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. To the
extent feasible, provide a copy of the VAERS form to ModernaTX, Inc. Please see the
REQUIREMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AND
VACCINE ADMINISTRATION ERRORS section for details on reporting to VAERS and
ModernaTX, Inc.
In a clinical study, the adverse reactions in participants 18 years of age and older following
administration of the primary series included pain at the injection site (92.0%), fatigue (70.0%),
headache (64.7%), myalgia (61.5%), arthralgia (46.4%), chills (45.4%), nausea/vomiting
(23.0%), axillary swelling/tenderness (19.8%), fever (15.5%), swelling at the injection site
(14.7%), and erythema at the injection site (10.0%).
In a clinical study, the adverse reactions in participants 18 years of age and older following
administration of a booster dose included pain at the injection site (83.8%), fatigue (58.7%),
headache (55.1%), myalgia (49.1%), arthralgia (41.3%), chills (35.3%), axillary
swelling/tenderness (20.4%), nausea/vomiting (11.4%), fever (6.6%), swelling at the injection
site (5.4%), and erythema at the injection site (4.8%), rash (1.8%).
Anaphylaxis and other severe allergic reactions, myocarditis, pericarditis, and syncope have been
reported following administration of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine outside of clinical trials.
6.1  Clinical Trials Experience
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates
observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical
trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
Overall, 15,419 participants aged 18 years and older received at least one dose of Moderna
COVID-19 Vaccine in three clinical trials (NCT04283461, NCT04405076, and NCT04470427).
In a fourth clinical trial (NCT04885907), 60 solid organ transplant recipients received a third
dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.
Two-Dose Primary Series
The safety of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine was evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3 randomized,
placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical trial conducted in the United States involving 30,351
participants 18 years of age and older who received at least one dose (0.5 mL) of Moderna
COVID-19 Vaccine (n=15,185) or placebo (n=15,166) (Study 1, NCT04470427). At the time of
Revised: Oct/20/2021                                                                                  15

vaccination, the mean age of the population was 52 years (range 18-95); 22,831 (75.2%) of
participants were 18 to 64 years of age and 7,520 (24.8%) of participants were 65 years of age
and older. Overall, 52.7% were male, 47.3% were female, 20.5% were Hispanic or Latino,
79.2% were White, 10.2% were African American, 4.6% were Asian, 0.8% were American
Indian or Alaska Native, 0.2% were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 2.1% were other races,
and 2.1% were Multiracial. Demographic characteristics were similar among participants who
received Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine and those who received placebo.
Solicited Adverse Reactions
Local and systemic adverse reactions and use of antipyretic medication were solicited in an
electronic diary for 7 days following each injection (i.e., day of vaccination and the next 6 days)
among participants receiving Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (n=15,179) and participants
receiving placebo (n=15,163) with at least 1 documented dose. Events that persisted for more
than 7 days were followed until resolution. Solicited adverse reactions were reported more
frequently among vaccine participants than placebo participants.
The reported number and percentage of the solicited local and systemic adverse reactions by age
group and dose are presented in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.

Solicited local and systemic adverse reactions reported following administration of Moderna
COVID-19 Vaccine had a median duration of 1 to 3 days.
Grade 3 solicited local adverse reactions were more frequently reported after Dose 2 than after
Dose 1. Solicited systemic adverse reactions were more frequently reported by vaccine recipients
after Dose 2 than after Dose 1.
Unsolicited Adverse Events
Participants were monitored for unsolicited adverse events for up to 28 days following each dose
and follow-up is ongoing. Serious adverse events and medically attended adverse events will be
recorded for the entire study duration of 2 years. As of November 25, 2020, among participants
who had received at least 1 dose of vaccine or placebo (vaccine=15,185, placebo=15,166),
unsolicited adverse events that occurred within 28 days following each vaccination were reported
by 23.9% of participants (n=3,632) who received Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine and 21.6% of
Revised: Oct/20/2021                                                                                                19

participants (n=3,277) who received placebo. In these analyses, 87.9% of study participants had
at least 28 days of follow-up after Dose 2.
Lymphadenopathy-related events that were not necessarily captured in the 7-day e-diary were
reported by 1.1% of vaccine recipients and 0.6% of placebo recipients. These events included
lymphadenopathy, lymphadenitis, lymph node pain, vaccination-site lymphadenopathy,
injection-site lymphadenopathy, and axillary mass, which were plausibly related to vaccination.
This imbalance is consistent with the imbalance observed for solicited axillary
swelling/tenderness in the injected arm.
Hypersensitivity adverse events were reported in 1.5% of vaccine recipients and 1.1% of placebo
recipients. Hypersensitivity events in the vaccine group included injection site rash and injection
site urticaria, which are likely related to vaccination. Delayed injection site reactions that began
>7 days after vaccination were reported in 1.2% of vaccine recipients and 0.4% of placebo
recipients. Delayed injection site reactions included pain, erythema, and swelling and are likely
related to vaccination.
Throughout the same period, there were three reports of Bell’s palsy in the Moderna COVID-19
Vaccine group (one of which was a serious adverse event), which occurred 22, 28, and 32 days
after vaccination, and one in the placebo group which occurred 17 days after vaccination.
Currently available information on Bell’s palsy is insufficient to determine a causal relationship
with the vaccine.
There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for
specific categories of adverse events (including other neurologic, neuro-inflammatory, and
thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.
Serious Adverse Events
As of November 25, 2020, serious adverse events were reported by 1.0% (n=147) of participants
who received Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine and 1.0% (n=153) of participants who received
placebo, one of which was the case of Bell’s palsy which occurred 32 days following receipt of
vaccine.
In these analyses, 87.9% of study participants had at least 28 days of follow-up after Dose 2, and
the median follow-up time for all participants was 9 weeks after Dose 2.
There were two serious adverse events of facial swelling in vaccine recipients with a history of
injection of dermatological fillers. The onset of swelling was reported 1 and 2 days, respectively,
after vaccination and was likely related to vaccination.
There was one serious adverse event of intractable nausea and vomiting in a participant with
prior history of severe headache and nausea requiring hospitalization. This event occurred 1 day
after vaccination and was likely related to vaccination.
There were no other notable patterns or imbalances between treatment groups for specific

categories of serious adverse events (including neurologic, neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic
events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.
Solid Organ Transplant Recipients
From an independent study (NCT04885907), in 60 participants who had undergone various solid
organ transplant procedures (heart, kidney, kidney-pancreas, liver, lung, pancreas) a median of
3.57 years previously (range 1.99-6.75 years) who received a third vaccine dose (0.5 mL), the
adverse event profile was similar to that after the second dose and no Grade 3 or Grade 4 events
were reported.
Booster Dose Following a Primary Series of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine
Study 2 is an ongoing Phase 2, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-
confirmation study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of the Moderna
COVID-19 Vaccine in participants 18 years of age and older (NCT04405076). In this study, 198
participants received two doses (0.5 mL 1 month apart) of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine
primary series. In an open label-phase, 171 of those participants received a single booster dose
(0.25 mL) at least 6 months (range of 5.8 to 8.5 months) after receiving the second dose of the
primary series. Safety monitoring after the booster dose was the same as that described for Study
1 participants who received the primary series.
Among the 171 booster dose recipients, the median age was 55 years (range 18-87), 39.2% were
male and 60.8% were female, 95.9% were White, 5.8% were Hispanic or Latino, 2.9% were
Black or African American, 0.6% were Asian, and 0.6% were American Indian or Alaska
Native. Following the booster dose, the median follow-up time was 5.7 months (range of 3.1 to
6.4 months).

In participants who received a booster dose, the median duration of solicited local and systemic
adverse reactions was 2 to 3 days.
Unsolicited Adverse Events
Overall, the 171 participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 5.7
months after the booster dose to the cut-off date (August 16, 2021). Through the cut-off date,
there were no unsolicited adverse events not already captured as solicited local and systemic
reactions that were considered causally related to the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.
Serious Adverse Events
Of the 171 participants who received a booster dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, there were
no serious adverse events reported from the booster dose through 28 days after the booster dose.
Through the cut-off date of August 16, 2021, there were no serious adverse events following the
booster dose considered causally related to the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.

completed primary vaccination with another authorized or approved COVID-19 Vaccine
(heterologous booster dose) is inferred from the safety of a Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (0.25
mL) booster dose administered following completion of a Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine primary
series (homologous booster dose) and from data from an independent Phase 1/2 open-label
clinical trial (NCT04889209) conducted in the United States that evaluated a heterologous
booster dose (0.5 mL) of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. In this study, adults who had
completed primary vaccination with a Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine 2-dose series (N=151), a
Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine single dose (N=156), or a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine 2-
dose series (N=151) at least 12 weeks prior to enrollment and who reported no history of SARS-
CoV-2 infection were randomized 1:1:1 to receive a booster dose of one of three vaccines:
Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (0.5 mL), Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, or Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 Vaccine. Adverse events were assessed through 28 days after the booster dose. An
overall review of adverse reactions reported following the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine
heterologous booster dose (0.5 mL) did not identify any new safety concerns, as compared with
adverse reactions reported following Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine primary series doses or
homologous booster dose (0.25 mL).
6.2  Post-Authorization Experience
The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-authorization use of the
Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily, it is not always
possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine
exposure.
Cardiac Disorders: myocarditis, pericarditis
Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis
Nervous System Disorders: syncope

There are no data to assess the concomitant administration of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine
with other vaccines.
11  USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
11.1                                                                                                Pregnancy
Pregnancy Exposure Registry
There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to
Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine during pregnancy. Women who are vaccinated with Moderna
COVID-19 Vaccine during pregnancy are encouraged to enroll in the registry by calling 1-866-
MODERNA (1-866-663-3762).
Risk Summary
All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general
population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically
recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Available data on Moderna
COVID-19 Vaccine administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine-
associated risks in pregnancy.
In a developmental toxicity study, 0.2 mL of a vaccine formulation containing the same quantity
of nucleoside-modified messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) (100 mcg) and other ingredients
included in a single human dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine was administered to female rats
by the intramuscular route on four occasions: 28 and 14 days prior to mating, and on gestation

postnatal development were reported in the study.
11.2   Lactation
Risk Summary
Data are not available to assess the effects of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine on the breastfed
infant or on milk production/excretion.
11.3   Pediatric Use
Safety and effectiveness have not been assessed in persons less than 18 years of age. Emergency
Use Authorization of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine does not include use in individuals younger
than 18 years of age.
11.4  Geriatric Use
Clinical studies of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine included participants 65 years of age and older
receiving vaccine or placebo, and their data contribute to the overall assessment of safety and
efficacy. In an ongoing Phase 3 clinical study (Study 1) of primary series dosing (0.5 mL),
24.8% (n=7,520) of participants were 65 years of age and older and 4.6% (n=1,399) of
participants were 75 years of age and older. Vaccine efficacy in participants 65 years of age and
older was 86.4% (95% CI 61.4, 95.2) compared to 95.6% (95% CI 90.6, 97.9) in participants 18
to <65 years of age [see Clinical Trial Results and Supporting Data for EUA (18)]. Overall,
there were no notable differences in the safety profiles observed in participants 65 years of age
and older and younger participants [see Overall Safety Summary (6.1)].
In an ongoing Phase 2 clinical study (Study 2) of a single booster dose (0.25 mL), 22.2% (n=38)
of participants were 65 years of age and older. This study did not include sufficient numbers of
participants 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently than
younger participants. Some local and systemic adverse reactions were reported in a lower
proportion of participants 65 years of age and older compared to participants 18 through 64 years
of age [see Overall Safety Summary (6.1)].
11.5 Use in Immunocompromised
In an independent study, safety and effectiveness of a third 0.5 mL primary series dose of the
Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine have been evaluated in participants who received solid organ
transplants [see Overall Safety Summary (6.1) and Clinical Trial Results and Supporting Data
for EUA (18.2)]. The administration of a third primary series vaccine dose appears to be only
moderately effective in increasing antibody titers. Patients should be counseled to maintain
physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, close contacts of
immunocompromised persons should be vaccinated, as appropriate for their health status.

13  DESCRIPTION
Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is provided as a white to off-white suspension for intramuscular
injection.
Each 0.5 mL dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine contains 100 mcg of nucleoside-modified
messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding the pre-fusion stabilized Spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-
CoV-2 virus. Each 0.5 mL dose of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine contains the following
ingredients: a total lipid content of 1.93 mg (SM-102, polyethylene glycol [PEG] 2000
dimyristoyl glycerol [DMG], cholesterol, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
[DSPC]), 0.31 mg tromethamine, 1.18 mg tromethamine hydrochloride, 0.043 mg acetic acid,
0.20 mg sodium acetate trihydrate, and 43.5 mg sucrose. Each 0.25 mL dose of Moderna
COVID-19 Vaccine contains half of these ingredients.
Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine does not contain a preservative.
The vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex.
14  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
14.1 Mechanism of Action
The nucleoside-modified mRNA in the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is formulated in lipid
particles, which enable delivery of the nucleoside-modified mRNA into host cells to allow
expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The vaccine elicits an immune response to the S
antigen, which protects against COVID-19.
18  CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS AND SUPPORTING DATA FOR EUA
18.1 Efficacy of Two-Dose Primary Series
Study 1 is an ongoing Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical trial to
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine in
participants 18 years of age and older in the United States (NCT04470427). Randomization was
stratified by age and health risk: 18 to <65 years of age without comorbidities (not at risk for
progression to severe COVID-19), 18 to <65 years of age with comorbidities (at risk for
progression to severe COVID-19), and 65 years of age and older with or without comorbidities.
Participants who were immunocompromised and those with a known history of SARS-CoV-2
infection were excluded from the study. Participants with no known history of SARS-CoV-2
infection but with positive laboratory results indicative of infection at study entry were included.
The study allowed for the inclusion of participants with stable pre-existing medical conditions,
defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening
disease during the 3 months before enrollment, as well as participants with stable human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A total of 30,420 participants were randomized equally
to receive 2 doses of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine or saline placebo 1 month apart.
Participants will be followed for efficacy and safety until 24 months after the second dose.
Revised: Oct/20/2021                                                                                   28

The primary efficacy analysis population (referred to as the Per-Protocol Set) included 28,207
participants who received two doses (0.5 mL at 0 and 1 month) of either Moderna COVID-19
Vaccine (n=14,134) or placebo (n=14,073), and had a negative baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. In
the Per-Protocol Set, 47.4% were female, 19.7% were Hispanic or Latino; 79.5% were White,
9.7% were African American, 4.6% were Asian, and 2.1% other races. The median age of
participants was 53 years (range 18-95) and 25.3% of participants were 65 years of age and
older. Of the study participants in the Per-Protocol Set, 18.5% were at increased risk of severe
COVID-19 due to at least one pre-existing medical condition (chronic lung disease, significant
cardiac disease, severe obesity, diabetes, liver disease, or HIV infection) regardless of age.
Between participants who received Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine and those who received
placebo, there were no notable differences in demographics or pre-existing medical conditions.
Efficacy Against COVID-19
COVID-19 was defined based on the following criteria: The participant must have experienced
at least two of the following systemic symptoms: fever (≥38ºC / ≥100.4°F), chills, myalgia,
headache, sore throat, new olfactory and taste disorder(s); or the participant must have
experienced at least one of the following respiratory signs/symptoms: cough, shortness of breath
or difficulty breathing, or clinical or radiographical evidence of pneumonia; and the participant
must have at least one NP swab, nasal swab, or saliva sample (or respiratory sample, if
hospitalized) positive for SARS- CoV-2 by RT-PCR. COVID-19 cases were adjudicated by a
Clinical Adjudication Committee.
The median length of follow up for efficacy for participants in the study was 9 weeks post Dose
2. There were 11 COVID-19 cases in the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine group and 185 cases in
the placebo group, with a vaccine efficacy of 94.1% (95% confidence interval of 89.3% to
96.8%).

Severe COVID-19 was defined based on confirmed COVID-19 as per the primary efficacy
endpoint case definition, plus any of the following: Clinical signs indicative of severe systemic
illness, respiratory rate ≥30 per minute, heart rate ≥125 beats per minute, SpO2 ≤93% on room
air at sea level or PaO2/FIO2 <300 mm Hg; or respiratory failure or ARDS (defined as needing
high-flow oxygen, non-invasive or mechanical ventilation, or ECMO), evidence of shock
(systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg, diastolic BP <60 mmHg or requiring vasopressors); or
significant acute renal, hepatic, or neurologic dysfunction; or admission to an intensive care unit
or death.
Among all participants in the Per-Protocol Set analysis, which included COVID-19 cases
confirmed by an adjudication committee, no cases of severe COVID-19 were reported in the
Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine group compared with 30 cases reported in the placebo group
(incidence rate 9.138 per 1,000 person-years). One PCR-positive case of severe COVID-19 in a
vaccine recipient was awaiting adjudication at the time of the analysis.
18.2 Immunogenicity in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients
An independent randomized-controlled study has been conducted in 120 participants who had
undergone various solid organ transplant procedures (heart, kidney, kidney-pancreas, liver, lung,
pancreas) a median of 3.57 years previously (range 1.99-6.75 years). A third 0.5 mL primary
series dose of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine was administered to 60 participants
approximately 2 months after they had received a second dose; saline placebo was given to 60
individuals for comparison. Significant increases in levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies occurred
four weeks after the third dose in 55.0% of participants in the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine
group (33 of 60) and 17.5% of participants in the placebo group (10 of 57).
Revised: Oct/20/2021                                                                                          30

18.3 Immunogenicity of a Booster Dose Following a Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Primary
Series
Effectiveness of a booster dose of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine was based on assessment of
neutralizing antibody titers (ID50) against a pseudovirus expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike
protein from a USA_WA1/2020 isolate carrying the D614G mutation. Immunogenicity analyses
compared the ID50 following the booster dose to the ID50 following the primary series.
In an open-label phase of Study 2, participants 18 years of age and older received a single
booster dose (0.25 mL) at least 6 months after completion of the primary series (two doses of 0.5
mL 1 month apart). The primary immunogenicity analysis population included 149 booster dose
participants in Study 2 (including one individual who had only received a single dose of the
primary series) and a random subset of 1055 participants from Study 1 who received two doses
(0.5 mL 1 month apart) of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. Study 1 and 2 participants included in
the analysis population had no serologic or virologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to
the first primary series dose and prior to the booster dose, respectively. Among participants
assessed for immunogenicity, 60.4% were female, 6.7% were Hispanic or Latino; 95.3% were
White, 3.4% were Black or African American, 0.7% were Asian, and 0.7% were American
Indian or Alaskan Native; 9.4% were obese (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2). The median age of
Study 2 participants was 56 years of age (range 18-82) and 24.8% of participants were 65 years
of age and older. Study 2 participants included in the primary immunogenicity analysis
population did not have pre-existing medical conditions that would place them at risk of severe
COVID-19. Study 1 participants included in the primary immunogenicity analysis population
were a stratified random sample which reflected the overall primary efficacy analysis population
with regards to demographics and pre-existing medical conditions with a higher percentage of
those ≥65 years of age (33.6%), with risk factors for severe COVID-19 (39.4%), and
communities of color (53.5%).
Immunogenicity analyses included an assessment of ID50 geometric mean titer (GMT) ratio and
difference in seroresponse rates. The analysis of the GMT ratio of ID50 following the booster
dose compared to the primary series met the immunobridging criteria for a booster response.
Seroresponse for a participant was defined as achieving a ≥4-fold rise in ID50 from baseline
(before the booster dose in Study 2 and before the first dose of the primary series in Study 1).
The lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in seroresponse rates between Study 1
and Study 2 was -16.7%, which did not meet the immunobridging criterion for a booster
response (lower limit of 2-sided 95% CI for the percentage difference of ≥ -10%). These
analyses are summarized in Tables 7 and 8.
Revised: Oct/20/2021                                                                                31

Study 2 participants who met the ≥4-fold increase in titer post-booster dose (87.9%) had a lower
baseline GMT of 109 (range of individual titers 9, 4393), whereas Study 2 participants who did
not meet the ≥4-fold increase in titers post-booster had a higher baseline GMT of 492 (range of
individual titers 162, 2239).
An additional descriptive analysis evaluated seroresponse rates using baseline neutralizing
antibody titers prior to dose 1 of the primary series. As shown in Table 9 below, the booster dose
seroresponse rate, with seroresponse defined as at least a 4-fold rise relative to the pre-dose 1

enrollment and who reported no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were randomized 1:1:1 to receive a
booster dose of one of three vaccines: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, or
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Neutralizing antibody titers, as measured by a pseudovirus
neutralization assay using a lentivirus expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein with D614G
mutation, were assessed on Day 1 prior to administration of the booster dose and on Day 15 after the
booster dose. A booster response to the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (0.5 mL) was demonstrated
regardless of primary vaccination.
